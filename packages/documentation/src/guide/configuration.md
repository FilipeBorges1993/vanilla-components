# Configuration

## Configuration structure

Components contain 3 major keys that can be set: `fixedClasses`, `classes`, `variants` & `props`, bellow we will explain what each of them means and what's their behaviour:

- **`fixedClasses`** - List of classes that are always persisted, even if the variant changes. This is usefull in case you want change the border color but still for example keep the same paddings & other relevant styles.
- **`classes`** - This contains the base classes for the "default" layout of the component.
- **`variants`** - This is a object with your own variant, each variant contains their own `classes` & `props`
- **`props`** - This will provide/override the default props for this component, so they are injected as you need.

With this little system, you can imagine that how flexible this can be, the limit is your imagination! We will get more deep on this bellow. You can see the demo of the **Input** config [here](https://github.com/nikuscs/vanilla-components/blob/0c8308bcfb2be5c59d6b3dbb9488157a6a1f95d4/packages/vanilla-components/src/components/input/config.ts#L35)

## Providing your own configuration

The library comes out of the box configured to be used with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com), you are free to change this configuration and provide your own when installing the plugin. The configuration keys can be found [here](https://github.com/nikuscs/vanilla-components/blob/0c8308bcfb2be5c59d6b3dbb9488157a6a1f95d4/packages/vanilla-components/src/configuration.ts#L9), you can even include configuration for your own components and ***leverage the configuration system*** for your own components

:::details ðŸŽ¨ Note on the default Primary Color for Tailwind
The color used by default is called **primary** so please extend your tailwind.config.js to have the primary color as you wish.

Here is a demo tailwind configuration:

```js
const defaultTheme = require('tailwindcss/defaultTheme');
const colors = require('tailwindcss/colors');
module.exports = {
    // the rest of  your configuration..
    theme: {
        colors: {
            primary: colors.indigo, // alias "primary" to "indigo"
        },
    },
    plugins: [
        require('@tailwindcss/typography'),
        require('@tailwindcss/aspect-ratio'),
        require('@tailwindcss/forms'),
    ],
}
```
:::

Here is a small demo overriding the `Input` component:

```js{2,6-14}
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import { Plugin } from '@indigit/vanilla-components'
const app = createApp()

app.use(VanillaComponents, {
    Input: {
        fixedClasses: {
          input: 'm-5 shadow-xl',
        },
        classes: {
          input: 'bg-purple-100 border-pruple-100',
          wrapper: 'relative-custom',
        },
  },
})
```

Please also do note, that when you override you will lose the default styling for this component, means that you will have to configure this component on your own. You can find our presets on the official github


## Style your own components

That's all clear when you want to override our components, but what if you want to keep a single design system in place and also style your own components? That's ok! You can still include the configuration as it was a "regular" Vanilla component, like the following:

```js{2,6-14}
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import { Plugin } from '@indigit/vanilla-components'
const app = createApp()

app.use(VanillaComponents, {
    MyOwnComponent: {
        fixedClasses: {
          input: 'border-t-md',
          anotherWeirdContainer: 'border-b-0'
        },
        classes: {
          input: 'bg-indigo-100 border-indigo-300',
          anotherWeirdContainer: 'border-t-0'
        },
  },
})
```


Here is a demo structure on how we recommend to have it structured in your project.
Where the `config.ts` is your configuration file with your Configuration and Types ( if that's the case)

```
.
â”œâ”€ src
   â”œâ”€ components
      â”œâ”€ MyOwnComponent
         â””â”€ MyOwnComponent.vue
         â””â”€ config.ts
```

Here is a small custom Vue component example `MyOwnComponent.vue`

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { useConfiguration } from '@indigit/vanilla-components'
import type { MyOwnComponentProps } from './config'
import { myOwnComponentConfig } from './config'
const { 
	configuration,
    errors,
    hasErrors 
} = useConfiguration<MyOwnComponentProps>(
    myOwnComponentConfig,
    'MyOwnComponent'
)

</script>
<template>
  <div :class="configuration.classesList.someClassYouWant">
    I will have the background you define in config
  </div>
</template>
```

And here is the configuration being imported as `config.ts` on the component

```ts
import type { InputHTMLAttributes } from 'vue'
import type { Data, WithVariantPropsAndClassesList } from '@indigit/vanilla-components'

export const myOwnComponentConfig = {
    
  // Classes that will always be injected
  fixedClasses: {
    someClassYouWant: 'i-will-be-a-fixed-class',
  },

  // Default appearance
  classes: {
    someClassYouWant: 'bg-indigo-100',
  },

  // Variants
  variants: {

    // Used for Errors
    error: {
      classes: {
        someClassYouWant: 'bg-red-100',
      },
    },

    // More variants can go here
  },
}

export const myOwnComponentClassesKeys = Object.keys(myOwnComponentConfig.classes)

export declare type MyOwnComponentClassesValidKeys = keyof typeof myOwnComponentConfig.classes

export declare type MyOwnComponentProps = WithVariantPropsAndClassesList<{
  type?: string
  placeholder?: string
} & InputHTMLAttributes & Data, MyOwnComponentClassesValidKeys>
```

Finally! You might use your component as any other component like the follwing: 

```vue
<template>
    <!-- This will render the default style -->
	<MyOwnComponent />
    
    <!-- This will render the errors one -->
    <MyOwnComponent variant="error" />
</template>
```

## **useConfiguration**

The `useConfiguration` provided by the package, takes 3 arguments: 

- The first argument ( Required ) - **default** configuration of the component, this the configuration of classes & fixed classes for the given component if nothing else is provided.

- The second argument ( Required ) - **name** of your component, you can give any name of your choice, as long as it matches the name provided on the initial `app.use(VanillaComponents,{})` configuration provided to vue.

- The third argument is a `Ref` usually your model value, this will ensure that if your component is on a state error and you change the model value, it will go back into the original variant, this is optional.

It also returns the following refs for your own usage on the template

- **configuration** - Contains the component configuration with classes, props, etc.
- **errors** - Contains the errors of the component if any
- **hasErrors** - Boolean that contains if the component has / not errors

Here is a small example of using `useConfiguration`: 

```vue
<script setup>
import { useConfiguration } from '@indigit/vanilla-components'
const { 
	configuration,
    errors,
    hasErrors 
} = useConfiguration(
	{
        fixedClasses: {
          someClassYouWant: 'i-will-be-a-fixed-class',
        },

        // Default appearance
        classes: {
          someClassYouWant: 'bg-indigo-100',
        },

        // Variants
        variants: {
            // More variants can go here
        },
    },
    'MyOwnComponent'
)

</script>
<template>
  <div :class="configuration.classesList.someClassYouWant">
    I will have the background you define in config
  </div>
</template>
```

That's it! With this in mind you are free to start being creative and create your own thing.

# IDE Configuration

If you are using Vscode you should have nothing to worry about, it will automatically detect the components and provide you with the correct intellisense.
But if you are using PHPStorm there is some things you should be aware of.

## Vscode / Code

Nothing to add here, should work out of the box.

## PHPStorm

Sometimes PHPstorm doesnt understand the `components.d.ts` generated by unplugin, specially if you are using `pnpm` as a workaround
please create a file on your project root with the name `.npmrc` and add the following content:

```ini
public-hoist-pattern[]=@vue*
shamefully-hoist=true
```

Recently we have added support for [Webtypes](https://github.com/JetBrains/) :pray: so for latest versions of Jetbrains IDE you should get full support for the components when it comes to illentisense and auto import.
